Sex, drugs, and rock and roll. There wasn’t a care in the world within that great town of fresh powder (oh you were thinking of snow! Yeah that too). Man, the partying just never stopped. That was before the great avalanches began...","The seismologists and geologists couldn’t figure out what caused them, but every occurrence was wiping out hundreds of park goers.

They were so far up the mountain, you could barely make out their peculiar shape…","There were even some stories, probably loosely translated over the years, that claimed the avalanche chaos caused supplies like booze and cigs to go missing from the storages. The thieves would leave no evidence behind except for the trail of snow they had tracked indoors from the dark, solemn night..."],step:0}}},r=o(27),component=Object(r.a)(n,(function(){var e=this,t=e.$createElement,o=e._self._c||t;return o("div",[o("div",{staticClass:"bg-white p-4 pt-6 pb-10 min-h-10rem relative"},[o("p",{staticClass:"text-xl"},[e._v("\n      "+e._s(e.blurb)+"\n    ")]),e._v(" "),o("p",{staticClass:"absolute text-sm bottom-0 right-0 text-gray-400 p-2 px-4"},[e._v(e._s(e.step+1)+" / "+e._s(e.blurbs.length))])]),e._v(" "),o("div",{staticClass:"flex flex-row flex-wrap justify-evenly"},[o("s-link",{staticClass:"text-2xl bg-red-500 md:mx-2",attrs:{to:"/mint"}},[e._v("THAT'S ENOUGH OLD MAN")]),e._v(" "),o("s-button",{staticClass:"text-2xl bg-red-500 md:mx-2",nativeOn:{click:function(t){e.step=(e.step+1)%e.blurbs.length}}},[e._v("TELL ME MORE!")])],1)])}),[],!1,null,null,null);t.default=component.exports;installComponents(component,{SLink:o(247).default,SButton:o(246).default})}}]);
